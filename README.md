This is my source code and other related documentation for my Software Architecture module from final year. 
Inside the "Documentation" folder you can find the work packages which initally outlined what each member of the group was to do as well as my summary document which is a final write-up of the project.
Inside the "Media" folder there is a video which demonstrates the work.
Inside "Pub" is the exported code, and inside "Source" is the source code. 

Reading through my summary document will give a good idea of what went into this project, and highlights the testing I undertook.
